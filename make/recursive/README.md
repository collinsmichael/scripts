# romtool
RomTool is a web server that takes as input a CDROM (or any such archive), and exposes the filesystem contained there in. In order to support multiple ROM file formats, a different parser is used depending on the file extension (iso files are parsed by the iso parser).

RomTool has a web based front end, which is simply HTML that is generated by the ROM parser. The front end allows the system to present the contents of the ROM file as HTML forms. RomTool will communicate through HTTP requests.
